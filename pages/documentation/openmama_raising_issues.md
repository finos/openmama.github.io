* If you're not sure if it's an issue or not, ask us on the [developer mailing list](https://lists.openmama.org/mailman/listinfo/openmama-dev) or come chat with us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/OpenMAMA/OpenMAMA).
* Include as much information as possible
    * Recreation details.
    * [Platform(s)](openmama_supported_platforms.html) seen on.
    * Relevant code snippets.
    * Example output.
* If you're planning on working on the issue yourself, let us know!
    * Comment on the issue to limit duplication of effort.
* Instead of an issue, consider opening a [Pull Request](https://github.com/OpenMAMA/OpenMAMA/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr) if you already have code to look at.
    * Keeps all relevant information on one page.
