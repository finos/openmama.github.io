## Support Lifecycle

As OpenMAMA develops alongside infrastructures, the **project aims to support platforms for as long as production support is widely available from it's providers**. An example of this would be that of RHEL's first three [production phases](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata), during which OpenMAMA will be supported.

## Linux

- CentOS / RHEL 7 (x64)
- CentOS Stream / RHEL 8 (x64)
- CentOS Stream / RHEL 9 (x64)
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (x64)
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (x64)
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (x64)

Although not strictly supported, OpenMAMA will most likely run fine on other Linux distros.
As long as OpenMAMA's dependancies have been installed OpenMAMA should build and run. For further help, please refer to our 
[documentation for building OpenMAMA from source](openmama_build_instructions.html).

## Windows

Currently, the following Windows versions are supported:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11
- Windows Server 2012
- Windows Server 2012-R2
- Windows Server 2016
